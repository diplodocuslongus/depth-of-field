# Depth Of Field Simulator

A web application that allows you to figure out the depth of field of a camera lens. You can adjust the aperture, focal length, and distance to the subject to see how the depth of field changes. The application also shows the hyperfocal distance and the near and far limits of the depth of field. [Live Demo](https://jherr.github.io/depth-of-field/)
